# KNN Classification Project: Predicting 'TARGET CLASS'

## Overview
This project focuses on using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify a dataset into different classes based on input features. The dataset used is artificial and involves features that have been standardized for analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset, 'KNN_Project_Data.csv', includes the following columns:
- Various features (standardized)
- Target variable: 'TARGET CLASS' (binary classification)

## Steps and Methodology

### 1. Getting the Data
- Load the dataset using Pandas and check the initial rows to understand the structure.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between features using a pairplot colored by the 'TARGET CLASS' to identify potential patterns.

### 3. Standardize the Variables
- Use StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the feature variables, ensuring each feature contributes equally.

### 4. Train-Test Split
- Split the standardized data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

### 5. Using KNN for Classification
- Implement KNN by importing KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn.
- Train the KNN model with an initial choice of n_neighbors=1 and evaluate its performance.

### 6. Predictions and Evaluations
- Make predictions using the trained KNN model and evaluate its accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report.

### 7. Choosing a K Value
- Utilize the elbow method to determine the optimal K value by iterating over various K values and plotting the error rate.

### 8. Retrain with Optimal K Value
- Retrain the KNN model with the identified optimal K value and re-evaluate its performance using classification report and confusion matrix.
